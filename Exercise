Exercise: Building an End-to-End ML Pipeline on AWS
Objective: Develop an end-to-end ML pipeline on AWS, integrating data preprocessing, model training, model deployment, and monitoring.
Steps:
1. Dataset Selection: Choose a publicly available dataset from a domain of your interest. It could be related to image classification, sentiment analysis, or any other task that suits your preference.
2. Data Preprocessing: Develop a Python script or notebook that performs data preprocessing tasks, such as data cleaning,
feature engineering, and splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.
3. Model Training: Implement a Python script or notebook to train an ML model on the preprocessed data.
Use a popular ML library like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn. Experiment with different algorithms and 
hyperparameters to improve model performance.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on the validation dataset to measure its performance metrics, such as accuracy,
precision, recall, or F1 score. Implement these evaluations within your training script or in a separate evaluation script.
5. Model Persistence: Save the trained model to disk using a format like TensorFlow SavedModel or scikit-learn pickle. 
This step allows you to load the model later for predictions.
6. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model as an API endpoint on AWS using a serverless service like AWS Lambda or AWS Elastic Beanstalk. 
Implement the API endpoint in Python using a framework like Flask or FastAPI.
7. Infrastructure Provisioning: Use your AWS student account to provision necessary infrastructure resources, such as an AWS Lambda function,
API Gateway, or EC2 instance. You can use either the AWS Management Console or Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform.
8. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD): Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a tool like AWS CodePipeline or Jenkins to automate the 
deployment process. Configure the pipeline to trigger whenever new code is committed to the repository, ensuring that changes to your ML pipeline are automatically deployed.
9. Monitoring and Logging: Implement monitoring and logging for your ML pipeline using services like AWS CloudWatch or open-source tools 
like Prometheus and Grafana. Capture relevant metrics and logs, set up alarms, and create visualizations to monitor the performance and health of your pipeline.
10. Documentation and Collaboration: Create documentation that outlines the architecture, components, and deployment instructions for 
your ML pipeline. Share this documentation with your team or colleagues, encouraging collaboration and knowledge sharing.
Completing this exercise will give you hands-on experience in building a complete ML pipeline on AWS, which is a common task for MLops Engineers.
It will also allow you to demonstrate your understanding of data preprocessing, model training, deployment, and monitoring, which are essential skills in the field.
