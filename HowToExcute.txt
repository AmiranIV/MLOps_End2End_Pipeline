1. Step one create the ,Linear regression model.
Take a data set and analyze, and clean the data and create a model that fits your requirements and preforms well.

2. save the model to your local using joblib.

3. build an application using flask framework , and implement the model as you wish,
my case i wanted the model to predict the yearly time usage of instagram by users.

4. create a templates folder containing html files that connects with your application functionality. 

5. make sure you have a main project directory  builds like this ----> [[ venv (dir),templates(dir), main.py(file), model name(file)]]

6. install nginx (and its dependancies) and modify the default configuration file they supply with nginx installation, to be able to 
run your application on nginx, then restart nginx.

7. In the last part you need to RUN the python script (main.py) first, then access the ip you filled in the configuration file on a web browswer.
